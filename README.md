Green Cat
=========

Experimental Instant Run plugin for Android Studio.

The plugin can be used when [Google's Instant Run](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/index.html#instant-run) is too slow to be instant or stops working at all. Don't consider GreenCat as a full-replacement build tool for your apps, because it has a pretty narrow area of usage.
