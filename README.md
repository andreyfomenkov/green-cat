Green Cat
=========

Experimental Instant Run plugin for Android Studio.

The plugin can be used when [Google's Instant Run](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/index.html#instant-run) is too slow to be instant or stops working at all. Don't consider GreenCat as a full-replacement build tool for your apps because it has a pretty narrow area of usage.

Check out the list of features supported or to be done:
- [x] Incremental build for .java files
- [x] Devices support with Android 7+
- [ ] Annotation processing
- [ ] Incremental build for XML resources (layouts, strings, dimens, etc.)
- [ ] Devices support with Android 5.x and 6.x

Components and properties
-------------------------

GreenCat consists of 3 main components:
- Wrapper plugin for Android Studio
- JAR library
- Code injection part in your Android application

How to
------

First of all, compiling, building and deploying initially based on .class files, resources and APKs prepared by Android Studio.

Known issues
------------

As mentioned before you should build and run your project on Android device prior to start using GreenCat plugin. For some reasons you can get *strange* crashes when playing with your app after deploying incremental changes using the plugin. The origin of problem is bytecode inconsistency between .class files generated by IDE and .class files from GreenCat. This can happen sometimes if you add **public** or **protected** methods/variables into existing Java code. If you're facing with this situation just run Cleanup into plugin toolbar and run desired changes with a common Run... action in Android Studio. I'm working on this issuse and I'll fix it... I guess :neutral_face:
